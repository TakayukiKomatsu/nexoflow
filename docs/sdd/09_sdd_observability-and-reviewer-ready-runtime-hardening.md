# Prompt 09 — Observability and reviewer-ready runtime hardening

Self-contained execution prompt for the SRM Credit Engine. Execute from the repository root. Requirements: [`docs/README_case_dev_srm.md`](../README_case_dev_srm.md), [`docs/SRM_REQUIREMENTS_PLAN.md`](../SRM_REQUIREMENTS_PLAN.md), and [`docs/CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md). The global contract below is mandatory for this increment.

## Global execution contract

This contract applies to Prompts 01–12 and is not optional.

### Baseline, scope, and dependencies

1. Read `docs/README_case_dev_srm.md`, `docs/SRM_REQUIREMENTS_PLAN.md`, `docs/CONTEXT.md`, this contract, the current prompt, existing ADRs, migrations, OpenAPI, feature files, and prior prompt evidence. Use the canonical domain terms from `docs/CONTEXT.md`; resolve a new or conflicting domain term there immediately, not in implementation code or an ADR.
2. Inspect `git status --short` and the staged index before and after the increment. Preserve unrelated changes; never blanket-stage. Handoff with an empty staged index.
3. Run the named baseline/regression command before editing. Stop on an unexpected failure or an unmet prerequisite. Never skip, disable, weaken, or silently rewrite a test to get green.
4. Implement only the prompt scope. Keep optional IaC, real microservices, a real IdP/market provider, refresh tokens, dashboards, and actual 1M-transactions/minute infrastructure out of scope.
5. Use Java 21, Spring Boot 3, PostgreSQL/Flyway, React/TypeScript, and the repository-selected pinned tool versions. Controllers contain no business logic; application Modules own transactions; domain code avoids framework coupling; SQL read models may bypass domain reconstruction.

### Module design and domain language

- A **Module** presents one small **Interface** at an explicit **Seam**. Its Interface includes its invariants, ordering, error modes, configuration, and performance characteristics—not just types or public methods.
- Prefer deep Modules: callers obtain substantial behavior through a small Interface. Hide orchestration, persistence mechanics, retries, locking, rounding mechanics, and provider protocols in the Module's Implementation. Do not create shallow pass-through Modules.
- Introduce an Adapter at a Seam only where behavior genuinely varies now (for example, a mock versus HTTP FX provider, or PostgreSQL versus an in-memory test Adapter). One Adapter alone is a hypothetical Seam and must be justified.
- Callers and tests cross the same Interface. Accept dependencies at internal Seams rather than constructing them in domain logic; return results rather than leaking side effects. Apply the deletion test: deleting a Module should force its hidden complexity back into multiple callers.
- When a prompt resolves business language, update `docs/CONTEXT.md` inline using the domain-model format. Create or amend an ADR only for a hard-to-reverse, surprising trade-off with real alternatives; ADRs must not become a domain glossary.

### Executable specification and TDD

- Every business/API feature is specified in Gherkin and executed with Cucumber-JUnit against Spring and PostgreSQL Testcontainers. The critical browser feature is executed with Playwright BDD or an equally direct feature-to-test adapter.
- Every feature and scenario has a stable ID (for example `PRICE-001`) visible in the test report. Every step names a real role/actor, fixed fixture, concrete request/action, and exact observable response, row/state change, event, log, or metric. Tautologies and prose-only assertions are forbidden.
- Infrastructure/documentation contracts use executable shell, schema, OpenAPI, Mermaid, and link tests rather than artificial Gherkin; externally observable infrastructure behavior may use Gherkin.
- For each coherent behavior: **RED** — add the smallest meaningful test and capture the expected failure; **GREEN** — implement only enough and run the focused plus relevant regression suites; **REFACTOR** — improve design while green. Record RED/GREEN commands and concise output.
- Use unit tests for financial/domain boundaries, Cucumber/API tests for contracts, Testcontainers for migrations/transactions/authorization, deterministic barrier-based PostgreSQL concurrency tests, component tests for UI state, and Playwright for the critical path. No sleeps in concurrency/E2E synchronization.
- Exact financial values travel as decimal strings. Java authoritative code uses `BigDecimal`, never `float`/`double`; JavaScript never calculates authoritative financial outcomes. Use `NUMERIC(19,4)` for stored money, `NUMERIC(19,10)` for rates/intermediates where specified, `HALF_EVEN` at currency boundaries, and an injectable `Clock` for all time-dependent behavior.

### Git, security, and authorization boundaries

- Work on the prompt’s named focused branch, never directly on `main`. Use GitHub Flow, Conventional Commits, protected-main review/check expectations, and rebase-before-merge only while the branch is unpublished.
- Commit migrations, persistence, production code, and tests together when they form one indivisible green contract. Make local atomic commits only when the focused and regression gates are green. The isolated crisis exercise in Prompt 12 is the sole, tightly scoped red-commit exception.
- Local branch creation and local commits are allowed. Do **not** push, create/merge a PR, rebase a shared branch, force-push, change repository visibility, publish evidence/release, or create/push a tag without the explicit authorization gate in Prompt 12. Never fabricate URLs, checks, reviews, or remote evidence.
- Never expose credentials, JWTs, idempotency keys, personal data, secrets, or unrestricted financial payloads in logs/evidence. Scan fixtures as well as source. A fake-secret test fixture must be unmistakably non-live and allowlisted only by exact path/reason if required.

### Required increment handoff

An increment is accepted only with: stable scenario report IDs; RED and GREEN output; focused and regression commands/results; changed files; migrations/contracts affected; local commit hashes/messages; security or query evidence requested by the prompt; residual risks/deferrals; `git status --short`; and proof that the staged index is empty. If a command is unavailable or an authorization gate is closed, report `blocked`, never `passed`.

## Timebox, dependencies, and review gates

- **Day 1:** Prompts 01–03. **Day 2:** 04–06. **Day 3:** 07–10. **Day 4:** 11–12 and review buffer.
- Strict chain: `01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06`; Prompt 07 depends on 03–06; Prompt 08 depends on 05–07; Prompt 09 depends on 02–08; Prompt 10 depends on all implementation prompts; Prompt 11 reconciles 01 with implemented truth; Prompt 12 requires every prior gate green.
- Review gates: foundation 01–02; core backend 03–04; integrity/ledger 05–06; operator UI 07–08; operations/release readiness 09–11; publication 12. Never cross a red financial-integrity or security gate.
- Prefer 5–6 reviewable PRs at authorized collaboration time: foundation, core backend, integrity/ledger, operator UI, operations/evidence, documentation/release. Do not create 12 trivial PRs or one unreviewable dump.

**Objective:** Make the complete financial path operable and observable without leaking or exploding cardinality.

**Prerequisites:** Prompts 02–08 green. Work on `feature/operational-hardening`.

**Scope:**

- Add bounded-cardinality metrics for simulation/quote, preview, settlement/idempotency/conflict, reversal, report, FX resilience; structured correlation/actor/event logs; separate append-only financial audit; liveness/readiness.
- Harden default reviewer Compose (backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, mock FX) with resource/timeouts, graceful startup/shutdown, non-root/read-only/minimal permissions where practical. Optional Prometheus profile may visualize mandatory metrics.
- Add host-tool-independent smoke flow: login → simulation → receivable/quote → preview → settlement → statement, plus representative metrics and correlated logs.
- Prove passwords, JWTs, idempotency keys, unrestricted financial payloads, and unbounded IDs never appear in logs or metric label values.

**Non-goals:** Production alerting platform, tracing vendor, Grafana dashboard, real secrets, or throughput claims.

**Operational contract:** Correlation ID is accepted/generated and returned. Metrics label only bounded enums/product/currency/result, never actor/record/correlation IDs. Readiness reflects dependencies while liveness reflects process.

**Executable acceptance:**

```gherkin
Feature: OBS safe financial observability
  Scenario: OBS-003 settlement conflict is observable without leaking credentials
    Given two settlement intents conflict on one receivable
    When OPERATOR request B receives 409 code "ALREADY_SETTLED" with correlation "obs-003-b"
    Then metric "srm_settlement_outcomes_total" has label result="conflict"
    And one controlled log contains correlation "obs-003-b"
    And captured logs and metrics contain neither request Idempotency-Key nor JWT
```

**Test mapping:** `OBS-003` → Cucumber plus metric registry/log capture. Log schema/redaction → integration snapshot and forbidden-pattern scan. Cardinality → static registry assertion. Full flow → Compose shell smoke.

**Verification:** Focused: `./backend/gradlew -p backend integrationTest --tests '*Observability*' && make test-log-redaction`. Regression: `docker compose up --build --wait && make smoke-financial-path && make inspect-observability && docker compose down -v && make verify`.

**Evidence:** Sanitized correlated log lines, metrics samples/label inventory, redaction scan, complete smoke response IDs/amounts, Compose health/resource output, and global handoff.

**Commit outcomes:** `feat(observability): instrument critical financial workflows`; `chore(runtime): harden reviewer Compose stack`.
